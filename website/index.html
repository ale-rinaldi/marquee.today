<h1>Hey!</h1>
<p>Just so you know, this is how the <i>marquee</i> tag is shown on your browser:</p>
<marquee>I'm a marquee!</marquee>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>It's amazing to me how such a specific, old-fashion tag is still in use today. It's worth celebrating!</p>
<h3>Is this website so basic to keep it old-fashion as well?</h3>
<p>Maybe. Or maybe I'm just lazy.</p>
<h4>Is it open source?</h4>
<p>I don't really understand why you would want it, but yeah, it's on <a href="https://github.com/ale-rinaldi/marquee.today" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<h5>Are you going to use all of the possible <em>title</em> tags?</h5>
<p>I'm not sure...</p>
<h6>Really?</h6>
<p>Nah, of course I am. Such a pity there's no <i>h7</i>!</p>
